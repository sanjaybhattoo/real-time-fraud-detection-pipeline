# Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-System
Project is based on event-driven architecture, real-time stream processing, and microservices design in production grade environment.

My Goals for project are :
1. project capacity upto 100k+ per sec 
2. 400ms for transaction to fraud detection. 

Technologies used : Python, Go, Node.js, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis .

System architecture followed :

Steps followed by me to implement this end to end : 

1. Project setup and Docker setup
2. Database schema design
3. Kafka setup - clusters and topics
4. Services :
       a. Transaction processor
       b. Feature enigine
       c. currently working on 



Goal : Latency timeline expected :

Can be scaled using combination of : Kafka partitioning + stateless microservices + Kubernetes HPA + databases

Example explanation of project : 

Customer Makes Payment
↓
Kafka (Event Hub) ← All transactions flow here
↓
Transaction Processor ← Validates data
↓
Feature Engine ← "Is this user normally in Arizona?"
↓
Model Service ← ML model: "Fraud risk = 72%"
↓
Decision Engine ← Apply rules: "70% risk = REVIEW"
↓
Alert Service ← Tell merchant & customer
↓
Database ← Store everything (for audit trail)
